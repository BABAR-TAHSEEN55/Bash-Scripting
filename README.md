In Linux Everything is a file !!!!
For example ,
go into cd /  
then do ,
cd bin
and you can find commands like ls , cat etc is a file

- Bin Contains all the command binaries
  #TODO : Create a simple file for storing Unique Commands which might come handy sometime
- hash -r
- sudo -i
- command -v
- grep -r -i "github CLI" /home/lelouch/tech/ 1>/dev/null -> R stands for recursive find in directories and subdirectories
